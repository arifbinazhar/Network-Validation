# Network-Validation
This Repository deals with our project on literature based validation of polypharmacology network of vitamins. 

Currently we aim to implement this validation project in three steps 
1> PubTator based validation of network 
2> Open Target Platform based labelling and ranking of the drug targets if any 
3> Passing the rest PMIDs through our Relation Extraction model that was trained on drug target prediction
4> Generate RAG + generation for the results using Langchain for user understanding.
